# üåü Review Collection System

## Overview
The Zek's Surf School review collection system allows customers to submit detailed feedback about their surf lessons through a URL-based form. Reviews are stored locally and managed through the admin panel.

## How It Works

### 1. Review Collection URL
After a lesson, email customers a link with pre-filled information:

```
https://your-domain.com/review?paymentId=PAY123&customerName=John%20Doe&customerEmail=john@example.com&lessonDate=2024-01-15&beach=Doheny&instructorName=Mike
```

### 2. URL Parameters
The system accepts these URL parameters to pre-fill the form:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `paymentId` | Payment reference ID (required) | `PAY123` |
| `customerName` | Customer's full name | `John Doe` |
| `customerEmail` | Customer's email address | `john@example.com` |
| `lessonDate` | Date of the lesson (YYYY-MM-DD) | `2024-01-15` |
| `beach` | Beach location | `Doheny`, `T-Street`, `San Onofre` |
| `instructorName` | Instructor's name | `Mike` |

### 3. Review Form Features
- **Star Ratings**: Overall, Instructor, Equipment, Experience (1-5 stars)
- **Written Review**: Title and detailed feedback
- **Additional Questions**: Recommendation, favorite aspects, improvements
- **Validation**: Prevents duplicate submissions per payment ID
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all devices

### 4. Data Collection
Each review captures:
- Customer information and lesson details
- Multiple rating categories
- Written feedback and recommendations
- Submission metadata (timestamp, IP address)
- Status tracking (pending/approved/rejected)

## Admin Management

### Accessing Reviews
1. Go to the admin debug portal
2. Navigate to the "‚≠ê Reviews" tab
3. View statistics and manage all reviews

### Review Management Features
- **Filter Reviews**: View all, pending, approved, or rejected
- **Approve/Reject**: Moderate reviews before publication

### Alternative Parameter Names
The system also accepts these alternative parameter names:

## Best Practices

### 1. Email Timing
- Send review requests 24-48 hours after the lesson
- Include lesson details in the email for context
- Use a friendly, personal tone

### 2. URL Construction
- Always include the payment ID (required)
- URL-encode special characters in names/emails
- Test links before sending to customers

### 3. Review Management
- Check for pending reviews daily
- Respond to negative feedback constructively
- Use approved reviews for marketing materials

### 4. Data Maintenance
- Export review data regularly for backup
- Monitor for spam or inappropriate content
- Track trends in customer feedback

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Review already submitted"**: Each payment ID can only submit one review
2. **Form validation errors**: Check required fields are filled
3. **URL parameters not working**: Ensure proper URL encoding

### Admin Access
- Default password: `ZeksSurf2024!Admin#Debug`
- Set custom password with `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_DEBUG_PASSWORD` environment variable
- Access URL is intentionally obscured for security
