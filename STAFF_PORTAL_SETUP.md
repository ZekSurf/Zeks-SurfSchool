4. In the "Create/Update Staff PIN" section:
   - Enter a 4-6 digit PIN (numbers only)
   - Click "Set PIN"
5. The PIN status will show as "‚úÖ Active"

### 2. Share Access with Staff

1. Provide staff with the obscure staff portal URL
2. Share the PIN (consider using a secure communication method)
3. Instruct staff to bookmark the URL for easy access

### 3. Staff Portal Usage

1. **Login**: Enter the PIN on the staff portal page
2. **Auto-Sync**: New bookings automatically sync when you log in
3. **Navigate**: Use Previous/Next Week buttons or "Current Week" to navigate  
4. **Manual Sync**: Click "üîÑ Sync New Bookings" to get latest payments
5. **View Details**: Click on any booking to see complete information
6. **Update Status**: In the booking details modal, use status buttons to mark lessons as completed or cancelled
7. **Contact Customers**: Click phone numbers or email addresses to initiate contact

## Status Color Coding

- **üîµ Blue**: Confirmed bookings
- **üü¢ Green**: Completed lessons
- **üî¥ Red**: Cancelled bookings

## Admin Management Features

### PIN Management
- **View Status**: See if PIN is active and when it was last used
- **Update PIN**: Change the PIN at any time
- **Deactivate**: Temporarily disable staff access
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor when the PIN was last used

### Booking Management
- **Statistics Dashboard**: View total, confirmed, completed, and cancelled bookings
- **Data Export**: Export all booking data as JSON
- **Demo Data**: Add sample bookings for testing
- **Data Clearing**: Remove all booking data (irreversible)

## Data Storage & Auto-Sync

### ‚úÖ **Auto-Sync Enabled!**
New payments from customers now **automatically** appear in the staff portal!

### How Auto-Sync Works
1. **Customer pays** ‚Üí Stripe webhook processes payment
2. **Server storage** ‚Üí Booking saved to temporary file storage
3. **Auto-sync on login** ‚Üí Staff portal automatically pulls new bookings when staff log in
4. **Manual sync** ‚Üí "üîÑ Sync New Bookings" button for on-demand updates
5. **Local cache** ‚Üí Synced bookings stored in browser localStorage for fast access

### Current Implementation
- **Hybrid Storage**: Server-side file storage + client-side localStorage
- **Automatic Sync**: New Stripe payments auto-sync to staff portal
- **Manual Sync**: On-demand sync button for latest updates
- **Per-Device Cache**: Each browser maintains its own local booking cache

### Future Considerations
- Upgrade to database storage for better scalability
- Real-time sync with WebSocket connections
- Multi-device synchronization improvements

## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **Protect Admin Access**: Keep admin password secure
2. **Regular PIN Updates**: Change staff PIN periodically
3. **Monitor Usage**: Check "Last Used" timestamps regularly
4. **Deactivate When Needed**: Disable PIN when staff member leaves

### For Staff
1. **Secure PIN**: Don't share PIN with unauthorized personnel
2. **Logout**: Always logout when finished
3. **Bookmark URL**: Save the obscure URL securely
4. **Report Issues**: Contact admin if PIN isn't working

## Troubleshooting

### Staff Can't Access Portal
1. **Check PIN Status**: Admin should verify PIN is active
2. **Verify URL**: Ensure correct obscure URL is being used
3. **Clear Browser Data**: Try clearing browser cache/localStorage
4. **Check Lockout**: Wait 15 minutes if multiple failed attempts

### No Bookings Showing
1. **Check Date Range**: Navigate to the correct week
2. **Add Demo Data**: Use admin panel to add test bookings
3. **Verify Data**: Check localStorage in browser developer tools

### Booking Status Not Updating
1. **Refresh Page**: Reload the staff portal page
2. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
3. **Clear Storage**: Clear localStorage and re-add demo data
